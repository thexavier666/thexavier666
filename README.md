## Hello there!

My name is [Sumitro Bhaumik][1]. Welcome to my Github repository.

I'm a [PhD researcher][2] from IIT Kharagpur, India.

While most of my research stuff is currently private, I keep my hobby projects here, mostly as a self-learning experience.
I sometimes check out other interesting open-source projects and help out if possible.
